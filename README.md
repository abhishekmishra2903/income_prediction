The data used in this project has been taken from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

This project is about classification, using different approaches like logistic regression, tree classifier, random forest etc, compare the results and probe into the deviations. Both training and testing datasets have been included in the repository and we aim to achieve atleast 80 percent accuaracy with the training dataset.

The ipynb file has been commented extensively and is quite elaborative with the steps taken and the rationale behind the same.
Please download all the three files in a single folder and run the ipynb file. Some modules will be required in jupyter e.g. Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy and Sklearn.
